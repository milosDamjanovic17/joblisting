Project integration and implementation of Spring Boot framework and MongoDB

** Import spring-boot-starter-data-mongodb dependency in pom.xml **

1) Define connection credentials in application.properties

2) Entity/Model classes are annotated with @Document( collection = "Collection-Name")

3) MongoDB comes with default basic out of the box CRUD query operations

4) To create our own Repo, create a class that extends MongoRepository<Entity, Key> and Impl class that implements interface

5) For query searching, go to Atlas or MongoCloud => Collections -> Aggregation -> Add Stage, once we finish staging the indexing -> Export to language
